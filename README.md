nodejs app I wrote to make reports as slideshows.

**TODO**

Automatize content adding.


##Usage

* `npm` 
* Add your content somehow to index.jade (Adding markdown from an external file should do it)
* `gulp` will compile to public/
* `gulp serve` will run a static server at [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
